This website was created during my month-long internship at KiyanPay (now known as kixy).

The goal of the website was to make companies using the website feel a more personalised experience, i.e if you are a food company, the website would be orientated 
around such a premise.

At first you are greeted with this page:

Here you select a company type - based on the company type selected the main page will be altered.

In this case the company type chosen was "Food" and the name entered was "Testcompany"

After selecting a company type you are redirected to the main page:
